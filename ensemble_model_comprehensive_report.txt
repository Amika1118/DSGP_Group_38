MODEL INTERPRETATION:
1. The ensemble outperforms individual models by -83229556675128208.0%
2. Wholesale price features contribute 0% to predictions
3. Time-based features (seasonality, trends) contribute 35%

DEPLOYMENT READINESS:
• Model files saved in 'model_registry/' directory
• API endpoint example provided
• Monitoring dashboard data generated
• All dependencies documented

RISK ASSESSMENT:
• Model Uncertainty: ±Rs.82.18 (average std)
• Extreme Events: Model may underestimate during supply shocks
• Data Drift: Recommend retraining every 6 months

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Deploy ensemble model for production predictions
2. Monitor actual vs predicted prices weekly
3. Retrain with new data quarterly
4. Expand vegetable coverage in next iteration
